#  Today

This repository was implemented by me following along Apple's official UIKit tutorial. Available [here](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/app-dev-training#uikit-essentials).

Although being an iOS enthusiast since it's origins, and having myself being an user from when the iPhone 3GS came to the public, my professional experience as a Java Developer never let me focus entirely in developing apps for this platform.
I always had a goal to create an app, with some ideas in my mind, but for time constraints and for the need of progress in my already on-going career as a Java engineer, never had a full commitment to this. As a result, my iOS creations were more of a hobby than a professional need.
After experimenting a lot with UIKit, and making some courses along the way, there was a growing need in refreshing the knowledge in modern iOS development with UIKit.

###But wait, why UIKit when SwiftUI is the hot new thing?

SwiftUI is great (and it is in my learning path), but it is still a very fresh neighbor in Apple's ecosystem. There is no doubt the new declarative approach SwiftUI provides is a great deal for new projects and for starter learners.
But iOS is a mature operating system and it's foundation is written, primarly in UIKit, with it's core living still in its core of Objective-C code (which I have some familiarity).
This great OS has a long history for its age, and since the inception of the App Store, it is evolving. UIKit is a fundamental part of it, and still, most of the apps out there are written in this framework, in modern Swift or even some in Obective-C.

The motivation is, as the big chunk of the apps are in UIKit, developers who know it have an advantage in being fluent in the framework. Swift is the same, but the UI layer is still fundamentally and mostly UIKit.

##What is the state of this repo?

As the tutorial in the link above, it is complete.
Additionally, I added localzation to my native language _Brazilian Portuguese_.
I plan to add a few extra small improvements to the UI in the near future.

##And then?
No further actions. This is a **learning repository**, and obviously this code won't go to the App Store.

##Get in touch!
I am happy to answer any question. I am no expert, but let's keep in touch!
